# Inconsistent useEffect Cleanup in React

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications: inconsistent execution of the cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook.  The problem arises when the cleanup function, crucial for releasing resources or managing side effects, is not called reliably when a component unmounts or when dependencies change.

## The Problem
The provided `bug.js` demonstrates an `useEffect` hook where the cleanup function (`console.log('Cleanup ran')`) is intended to be called before the next effect runs or when the component unmounts.  However, under certain conditions or edge cases, this function may be skipped, potentially leading to memory leaks, unexpected state behavior, or race conditions.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version. By carefully managing the dependency array (`[]` if no dependencies are needed, or the list of dependencies that trigger the effect), we can ensure the cleanup function is always executed at the appropriate moments.   Additionally, appropriate handling of asynchronous operations and error states are implemented to guarantee consistent cleanup.
